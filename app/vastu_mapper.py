vastu_mapper.py

Simple Vastu sector mapper & activation suggestion engine.

Input model (examples):
  {
    "plot_facing": "North",        # one of N, S, E, W or full names
    "main_entrance": "NE",        # compass sector or direction string
    "rooms": [
       {"name":"master_bed", "sector":"SW"},
       {"name":"kitchen", "sector":"SE"},
       {"name":"puja", "sector":"NE"},
    ],
    "plot_type": "apartment"      # optional: "house" | "apartment"
  }

Outputs:
  {
    "sectors": { "NE": {...}, "SW": {...} },
    "weak_sectors": ["NW", ...],
    "recommended_activations": [
       {"sector":"NE", "action":"place water element", "priority":1, "why":"Entrance faces north-east"},
       ...
    ]
  }

This is intentionally deterministic and conservative (no magical claims).
